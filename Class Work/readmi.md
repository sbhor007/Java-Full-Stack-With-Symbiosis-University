# Java Concepts Overview

## 1) What is JVM?
- **JVM** stands for **Java Virtual Machine**.
- It is an abstract computing machine that enables a computer to run Java programs.
- **JVM** performs all the tasks necessary for running Java applications, including loading and verifying code.
- It also handles **Garbage Collection** and provides a runtime environment.

### Key Parts of JVM
1. **Class Loader**
2. **Memory Area**
3. **Execution Engine**
4. **Garbage Collection**

## 2) What is JRE?
- **JRE** stands for **Java Runtime Environment**.
- It is the implementation of JVM, specifically designed to provide an executable environment for Java programs.
- It does not contain development tools like **compiler** or **debugger**.
- To execute a Java program, you need **JRE** but not **JDK**. However, to develop Java applications, you need **JDK**.

## 3) Features of Java
### 1) Simple
- Easy to learn, clean, and understand.

### 2) Object Oriented
- Java is an **Object-Oriented Programming Language**.

### 3) Platform Independent
- Java is platform-independent; bytecode can be executed on any platform.

### 4) Secure
- Java does not provide explicit pointers, and programs run in their own environment, making it secure.

### 5) Robust
- Strong memory management, lack of pointers, automatic garbage collection, exception handling, and type checking make Java a robust programming language.

### 6) Architectural Neutral
- The architecture is independent of implementation, e.g., the size of data types is fixed.

### 7) High Performance
- Java is faster than many interpreted programming languages.
